.  Download the latest `2Do.jar` from the link:../../../releases[releases] tab.
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your to-do list.
.  Double-click the file to start the application. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  When the application starts up, tasks due within a certain amount of time (the default is 1 day) will be displayed.
.  To interact with the task manager, open the main application.
.  You will then see a list of your tasks sorted by due date.
+
.  Below the list, there is a command box. Type a command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will display all commands available.
.  Some example commands you can try:
* *`add n/projectX`* : adds a task with *projectX* as its name
* *`list`* : lists all incomplete tasks
* *`delete 2`* : deletes the 2nd task shown in the current list
* *`quit`* : quits 2Do
.  Refer to the link:#features[Features] section below for details of each command.

*A*: The data is saved in the hard drive automatically, by default as _data/2Do.xml_ in the directory of the application, after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually. However, you may save it as another file using our link:#save-command[Save Command].

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the application in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous to-do list folder.
