.  Download the latest `2Do.jar` from the link:../../../releases[releases] tab.
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your to-do list.
.  Double-click the file to start the application. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  When the application starts up, tasks due within a certain amount of time (the default is 7 days) will be displayed.
.  To interact with the task manager, open the main application.
.  You will then see a list of your tasks sorted by due date.
+
.  Below the list, there is a command box. Type a command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will display all commands available.
.  Some example commands you can try:
* *`add projectX`* : adds a task with *projectX* as its name
* *`list`* : lists all tasks
* *`delete 2`* : deletes the 2nd task shown in the current list
* *`quit`* : quits 2Do
.  Refer to the link:#features[Features] section below for details of each command.
